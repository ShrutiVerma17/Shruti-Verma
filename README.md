Hi!

My name is Shruti Verma, and I am a first year Master's student studying Computer Science at Stanford University. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science (with an emphasis on intelligent systems) at Columbia University.

Iâ€™m passionate about working at the intersection of computer science and other related disciplines (such as genetics) to solve important problems and help people in need. I've worked both as a full stack well developer and as a machine learning researcher-- as long as I'm fixing bugs and optimizing algorithms, I'm happy!
