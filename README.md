Hi!

My name is Shruti Verma, and I am a sophomore at Columbia University studying Computer Science with on the 'Intelligent Systems' track.

Iâ€™m passionate about working at the intersection of computer science and other related disciplines (such as genetics) to solve important problems and help people in need. I've worked both as a full stack well developer and as a machine learning researcher-- as long as I'm fixing bugs and optimizing algorithms, I'm happy!
